1. Networking Fundamentals (Beginner Level)
Introduction to Networking
What is a network? LAN, WAN, MAN
Types of networks: Client-Server vs Peer-to-Peer
Topologies (Star, Mesh, Hybrid)
OSI & TCP/IP Models (7 layers explained with examples)
IP Addressing
IPv4, IPv6 basics
Subnetting, Supernetting
Private vs Public IP, APIPA, Loopback
Network Devices
Router, Switch, Hub, Access Point, Firewall, Load Balancer
L2 vs L3 Switches
Cabling & Wireless
Ethernet standards (Cat5/6/7, fiber)
Wi-Fi standards (802.11 a/b/g/n/ac/ax)
2. Routing & Switching (Intermediate Level)
Switching Concepts
VLANs, Trunking, Inter-VLAN routing
STP (Spanning Tree Protocol)
EtherChannel (Link Aggregation)
Routing Concepts
Static vs Dynamic Routing
Routing Protocols: RIP, OSPF, EIGRP, BGP
Route Redistribution
NAT & PAT
Static, Dynamic NAT
Port Address Translation (PAT)
3. Network Services & Protocols
DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol)
DNS (Domain Name System)
ARP, ICMP, NTP
SNMP (Monitoring Protocol)
VoIP basics
QoS (Quality of Service)
4. Network Security
Firewalls (Stateful, Stateless, NGFW)
ACLs (Access Control Lists)
VPNs (Site-to-Site, Remote Access, IPSec, SSL)
IDS/IPS basics (Snort, Suricata, etc.)
Security Best Practices:
Zero Trust
Network Segmentation
Least Privilege
5. Network Monitoring & Troubleshooting
Tools:
Wireshark (packet capture)
Tcpdump
Nmap (scanning)
Ping, Traceroute
Logs & Monitoring:
Syslog
NetFlow, sFlow
Troubleshooting Approach (Layer-wise using OSI model)
6. Wireless & Mobile Networking
